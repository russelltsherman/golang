SOLID Design Principleas
 `https://dave.cheney.net/2016/08/20/solid-go-design`

S | Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Software entities should have one primary responsibility and should have one, and only one, reason to change.

O | Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

L | Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Liskov substitution principle states, roughly, that two types are substitutable if they exhibit behaviour such that the caller is unable to tell the difference.

I | Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

D | Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
