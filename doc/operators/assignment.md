# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assigning a value to a variable.
The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable and right side operand of the assignment operator is a value.
The value on the right side must be of the same data-type of the variable on the left side otherwise the compiler will raise an error.

Different types of assignment operators are shown below:

| Operator | Description                |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| `=`      | Simple Assignment          |
| `+=`     | Add Assignment             |
| `-=`     | Subtract Assignment        |
| `*=`     | Multiply Assignment        |
| `/=`     | Divide Assignment          |
| `%=`     | Modulus Assignment         |
| `<<=`    | Left shift AND assignment  |
| `>>=`    | Right shift AND assignment |
| `&=`     | Bitwise AND Assignment     |
| `^=`     | Bitwise Exclusive OR       |
| `|=`     | Bitwise Inclusive OR       |

## Simple Assignment

This is the simplest assignment operator. This operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.

## Add Assignment

This operator is combination of `+` and `=` operators.
This operator first adds the current value of the variable on left to the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Subtract Assignment

This operator is combination of `-` and `=` operators.
This operator first subtracts the current value of the variable on left from the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Multiply Assignment

This operator is combination of `*` and `=` operators.
This operator first multiplies the current value of the variable on left to the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Division Assignment

This operator is combination of `/` and `=` operators.
This operator first divides the current value of the variable on left by the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Modulus Assignment

This operator is combination of `%` and `=` operators.
This operator first modulo the current value of the variable on left by the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Bitwise AND Assignment

This operator is combination of `&` and `=` operators.
This operator first “Bitwise AND” the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Bitwise Exclusive OR

This operator is combination of `^` and `=` operators.
This operator first “Bitwise Exclusive OR” the current value of the variable on left by the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

## Bitwise Inclusive OR

This operator is combination of `|` and `=` operators.
This operator first “Bitwise Inclusive OR” the current value of the variable on left by the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
