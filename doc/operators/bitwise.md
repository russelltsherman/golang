# Bitwise Operators

In Go language, there are 6 bitwise operators which work at bit level or used to perform bit by bit operations. Following are the bitwise operators :

| Operator | Description        |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| &        | Binary AND         |
| \|       | Binary OR          |
| ^        | Binary XOR         |
| ~        | Binary Complement  |
| <<       | Binary Left Shift  |
| >>       | Binary Right Shift |

## bitwise AND

Takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers.
The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.

## bitwise OR

Takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers.
The result of OR is 1 any of the two bits is 1.

## bitwise XOR

Takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers.
The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

## left shift

Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand,
the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

## right shift

Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand,
the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

## AND NOT

This is a bit clear operator.
