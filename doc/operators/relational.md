# Relational Operators

Relational operators are used for comparison of two values. Let’s see them one by one:

| Operator | Description         |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| ==       | is equal            |
| !=       | not equal           |
| <>       | not equal           |
| >        | is greater          |
| <        | is less             |
| >=       | is greater or equal |
| <=       | is less or equal    |

## is equal

checks whether the two given operands are equal or not.
If so, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
For example, 5==5 will return true.

## Not Equal To

checks whether the two given operands are equal or not.
If not, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
It is the exact boolean complement of the ‘==’ operator.
For example, 5!=5 will return false.

## Greater Than

whether the first operand is greater than the second operand.
If so, it returns true.
Otherwise it returns false.
For example, 6>5 will return true.

## Less Than

checks whether the first operand is lesser than the second operand.
If so, it returns true.
Otherwise it returns false.
For example, 6<5 will return false.

## Greater Than or Equal

checks whether the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand.
If so, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
For example, 5>=5 will return true.

## Less Than or Equal

checks whether the first operand is lesser than or equal to the second operand.
If so, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
For example, 5<=5 will also return true.
