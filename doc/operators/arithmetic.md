# Arithmetic Operators

These are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands in Go language:

| Operator | Description         |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition            |
| `-`      | Subtraction         |
| `*`      | Multiplication      |
| `/`      | Division            |
| `%`      | Modulus             |
| `++`     | Increment operator. |
| `--`     | Decrement operator. |

## Addition

The `+` operator adds two operands.

## Subtraction

The `-` operator subtracts two operands.

## Multiplication

The `*` operator multiplies two operands.

## Division

The `/` operator divides the first operand by the second.

## Modulus

The `%` operator returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second.

## Increment

The `++` operator It increases the integer value by one.

## Decrement

The `--` operator It decreases the integer value by one.

## Note

-, +, !, &, \*, <-, and ^ are also known as unary operators and the precedence of unary operators is higher. ++ and â€” operators are from statements they are not expressions, so they are out from the operator hierarchy.
