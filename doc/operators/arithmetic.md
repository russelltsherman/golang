# Arithmetic Operators

These are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands in Go language:

| Operator | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +        | Addition       |
| -        | Subtraction    |
| \*       | Multiplication |
| /        | Division       |
| %        | Modulus        |

## Addition

The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.

## Subtraction

The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.

## Multiplication

The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.

## Division

The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.

## Modulus

The ‘%’ operator returns the remainder when first operand is divided by the second. For example, x%y.

## Note

-, +, !, &, \*, <-, and ^ are also known as unary operators and the precedence of unary operators is higher. ++ and — operators are from statements they are not expressions, so they are out from the operator hierarchy.
