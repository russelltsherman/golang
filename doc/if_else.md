# Go Decision Making (if, if-else, Nested-if, if-else-if)

Decision making in programming is similar to decision making in real life.
In decision making, a piece of code is executed when the given condition is fulfilled.
Sometimes these are also termed as the Control flow statements.
Golang uses control statements to control the flow of execution of the program based on certain conditions.
These are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program.

The Decision making statements of Go programming are:

- if Statement
- if-else Statement
- Nested if Statement
- if-else-if Ladder

## if Statement

```go
if (condition) {
   // Statements to execute if
   // condition is true
}
```

## if-else statement

```go
if (condition) {
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is true
} else {

    // Executes this block if
    // condition is false
}
```

## if-else-if

```go
if (condition_1) {
     // this block will execute
     // when condition_1 is true
} else if (condition_2) {
    // this block will execute
    // when condition2 is true
} else {
    // this block will execute when none
    // of the condition is true
}
```
