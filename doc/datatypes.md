# Golang Data Types

Data types specify the type of data that a valid Go variable can hold.
In Go language, the type is divided into four categories which are as follows:

| Category       | Types                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic type     | Numbers, strings, and booleans come under this category.                  |
| Aggregate type | Array and structs come under this category.                               |
| Reference type | Pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channels come under this category. |
| Interface type | A custom time which defines minimum spec for parameter substitution        |
| Value type     | bool, float, int, string, and struct come under this category              |

Go has three basic data types:

bool: represents a boolean value and is either true or false
Numeric: represents integer types, floating point values, and complex types
string: represents a string value
