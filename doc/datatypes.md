# Golang Data Types

Data types specify the type of data that a valid Go variable can hold. In Go language, the type is divided into four categories which are as follows:

| Category       | Types                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic type     | Numbers, strings, and booleans come under this category.                  |
| Aggregate type | Array and structs come under this category.                               |
| Reference type | Pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channels come under this category. |
| Interface type |

Here, we will discuss Basic Data Types in the Go language. The Basic Data Types are further categorized into three subcategories which are:

Numbers
Booleans
Strings

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

| Category        | Types                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Text Type:      | str                          |
| Numeric Types:  | int, float, complex          |
| Sequence Types: | list, tuple, range           |
| Mapping Type:   | dict                         |
| Set Types:      | set, frozenset               |
| Boolean Type:   | bool                         |
| Binary Types:   | bytes, bytearray, memoryview |
